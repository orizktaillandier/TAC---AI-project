        "problem": "A dealer wants to send separate new and used vehicle feeds to the same syndicator. Clarify whether multiple feeds or separate feed IDs per syndicator are supported and how to achieve inventory-type separation.",
        "solution": "You cannot create more than one feed ID per syndicator. Instead, inventory separation (new vs used) is handled via inventory-type controls in the admin dashboard: for each syndicator you can select which inventory types to include using checkboxes. Configure those checkboxes to include only the inventory types you want the syndicator to receive.",
        "steps": [
          "Log in to the admin dashboard.",
          "Navigate to Syndicators (or the appropriate syndicator configuration page).",
          "Select the syndicator (e.g., Syndicator_Export_1) you want to configure.",
          "Locate the inventory-type checkboxes (typically labeled New, Used, CPO, etc.).",
          "Check only the inventory types you want this syndicator to receive. Uncheck the others.",
          "Save your changes. The single feed ID for that syndicator will now deliver only the selected inventory types.",
          "If you need different inventory selections for multiple endpoints, contact support to discuss alternatives (e.g., different syndicator accounts or custom routing if available)."

This ticket describes a different root cause — the syndicator's ingestion/end system was the problem despite correct FTP setup. The knowledge base lacks a specific troubleshooting and escalation playbook for cases where the feed export is confirmed working but the syndicator fails to ingest or update. Creating a new article for syndicator-side failures (including steps to confirm export health, gather evidence, contact syndicator support, and communicate with the dealer) will fill this gap.",
