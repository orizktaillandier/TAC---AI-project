      "reasoning": "Existing article (ID 6) states that the platform supports separate feeds for new vs used inventory. The resolution in the ticket clarifies current system behavior: we cannot create more than one feed ID per syndicator, but admins can control which inventory types (new/used) are included via checkboxes in the admin dashboard. This is a correction and improvement to the existing article and should replace the previous, potentially misleading statement.",

        "solution": "You cannot create more than one feed ID per syndicator. Instead, inventory separation (new vs used) is handled via inventory-type controls in the admin dashboard: for each syndicator you can select which inventory types to include using checkboxes. Configure those checkboxes to include only the inventory types you want the syndicator to receive.",

Request an ETA for resolution and ask them to confirm ingestion success once resolved.",
          "Step 7 — Escalate internally if needed: If syndicator does not respond within SLA or dealer impact is high, escalate to Syndication Team lead and include collected evidence and dealer contact frequency.",
          "Step 8 — Communicate with dealer: Provide the dealer with a concise status update including what you checked, that the feed delivery is verified, that the issue is with the syndicator, and the expected ETA or next update.",

          "Step 10 — Post-incident notes: Add a short postmortem note to the ticket: root cause, actions taken, contact with syndicator, and preventive recommendations (e.g., monitoring alerts or automated ingestion checks)."
