The resolution in the ticket clarifies current system behavior: we cannot create more than one feed ID per syndicator, but admins can control which inventory types (new/used) are included via checkboxes in the admin dashboard.

Instead, inventory separation (new vs used) is handled via inventory-type controls in the admin dashboard: for each syndicator you can select which inventory types to include using checkboxes.

Request an ETA for resolution and ask them to confirm ingestion success once resolved.",
